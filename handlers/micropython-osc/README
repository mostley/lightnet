## blink codes

the handler blinks 2 times clearly in the beginning of the boot process. The led turns off when the handler was started successfully.


## updating the software

to get into flash mode:
 * reset the chip (reset button, connect power or Strg-D in repl mode)
 * press the flash button when the led starts blinking and keep pressing it until it either blinks 5 times or turns off
 * if it turned off start over, it should blink 5 times rapidly and then stay on
 * Now you can call ./deploy.sh to flash the update.
